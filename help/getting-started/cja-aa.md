# Customer Journey Analytics feature support

The following tables list which features in Adobe Analytics are supported, partially supported or not supported in Customer Journey Analytics (CJA). These lists will change over time as features are added to CJA.

## Fully supported features/components

|Feature|Notes|
|---|---|
|Metrics|CJA leverages the Experience Data Model (XDM) and supports unlimited metrics and is not tied to the custom success events of traditional Analytics. Note that some standard metrics have been renamed from traditional Analytics: Visitors = People, Visits = Sessions, Hits = Events.|
|Dimensions|CJA leverages XDM and supports unlimited dimensions and is not tied to the custom success events of traditional Analytics.|
|List Variables/List Props|CJA leverages XDM and supports unlimited list variables|
|Date Ranges|Custom Calendar support is planned.|
|Calculated Metrics|Note that any existing calc metrics in the traditional Analysis Workspace will not be ported to CJA.|
|Segments|Now called "Filters" - note that any existing segments in traditional Analysis Workspace will not be ported to CJA.|
|Attribution IQ|Full Support|
|Project Curation|Full Support|
|Project Linking|Full Support|
|Date Comparisons|Full Support|
|Virtual Report Suites|Now called "Data Views".|
|VRS Component Curation|Now part of Data Views.|
|Report Time Processing|CJA relies on Report Time Processing exclusively.|
|GDPR Deletion|Note that GDPR is now handled in coordination with Adobe Experience Platform - CJA inherits whatever data changes Experience Platform makes to underlying datasets.|


## Supported with caveats

|Feature|Notes|
|---|---|
|Product Variable|The product variable is currently available for reporting for data conforming to the Experience Event schema (specifically using the productListItems object).
|Visualizations|All visualizations are supported except for the Map visualization.|
|AAM Audiences|If customers are using Analytics Data Connector datasets, this data will be part of the ADC data.|
|Project Sharing|Project sharing is only supported between users of CJA - there is not project sharing between CJA and the traditional Analysis Workspace.|
|Custom Sessionization|Support for all custom sessionization features other than mobile background hits.|
|eVar persistence settings|eVars are no longer part of CJA. However, persistence settings are now part of Data Views and are available for all dimensions. Keep in mind that persistence is based on report time processing, not data collection processing. This means all persistence will be based on the reporting date range rather than the entirety of the data.|
|Classifications|Now called "Lookup Datasets", they do not get automatically imported from traditional Analytics. They will have to be uploaded to AEP before they're available in CJA.|
|Customer Attributes|Now called "Profile Datasets", they do not get automatically imported from Experience Cloud, but will have to be uploaded to AEP before they're available in CJA.|

## Partial Support

|Feature|Notes|
|---|---|
|Out-of-the-box Analysis Workspace dimensions (e.g. Browser Type, Referrer Type, Marketing Channels, Visit Number etc.)|CJA does not provide these dimensions natively. For customers using the Analytics Data Connector (ADC), some of these dimensions are available, but not all. Please refer to our [documentation on which Analytics variables are supported via ADC](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/data-ingestion/data-ingestion-services.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/acp_connectors_overview/analytics_mapping_fields.md).|
|Panels|Blank Panel, Attribution Panel, and Freeform Panel are fully supported. Segment Comparison is not supported.|
|Merchandising eVars|Merchandising eVars will only work with ADC-based datasets unless they strictly conform to the same XDM schema (similar to the product list limitations above).|
|Bot Filtering|For ADC-based datasets, bot filtering is applied. General bot filtering logic for other datasets is not performed by the Experience Platform or CJA.|
|Processing Rules|For ADC-based datasets, processing rules are still applied.|
|Cross-Device Identity Stitching|Customers are limited to "one-time" stitches of the data via Query Service, or currently must apply this logic to data prior to Experience Platform data ingestion.|

## Not currently supported, but planned

|Feature|Notes|
|---|---|
|Anomaly Detection|Support is planned.|
|Contribution Analysis|Support is planned.|
|Segment IQ|Support is planned.|
|Segment Publishing (sending segments from Workspace to the Experience Cloud)|Support is planned.|
|User Permissions/Data Access Controls|All users in CJA have the same access controls - this means all users have access to all connections, data views, etc. Basically all users are admin level users in CJA. Support is planned for 2020.|
|CSV download|Support is planned.|
|Scheduled Reports/Projects|Support is planned.|
|Alerts|Support is planned.|
